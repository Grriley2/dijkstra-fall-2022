// Convert kebab case works to camel casing. 
// The first word within the output should be capitalized only if it is the first letter of a word and dashes should be removed.

// change-this-word gets converted into changeThisWord
// day-moth-year gets converted into dayMonthYear
// ALL-CAPS gets converted into allCaps
